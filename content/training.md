We meet weekly to discuss problems from past contests and introduce new techniques. We support all our members and will try our best to help you train.

We also encourage members with more available time to follow this [training sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iJZWP2nS_OB3kCTjq8L6TrJJ4o-5lhxDOyTaocSYc-k/edit#gid=84654839). The more you train, the better problem solver you become.

We also provide 1-on-1 coaching. If you are interested, [send us an email](mailto:spc.ubco@gmail.com).
