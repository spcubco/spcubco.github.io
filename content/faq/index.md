## General

### What is SPC?

SPC is a student-run club dedicated to foster a programming community on the UBC Okanagan campus. We provide resources and training for our members to excel at programming competitions at the national and international levels.

### How do I become a club member?

Fill in the [membership form](https://forms.gle/HwRk2USpKdYcAzq26) to become a club member.

### How do I contact SPC?

Send us an email - our address is spc.ubco@gmail.com.

### Do I need to know how to program to join SPC?

Programming is not a pre-requisite to join SPC - it is something our members learn with time. Our members become better programmers through practice.

If you have the dedication to learn to program and come to all our practices, we want to have you in our club!

### Which programming language should I use?

The one you are the most comfortable with - many competitions support over 20+ languages, such as Google Code Jam. Chances are you can choose your preferred language. 

It is more important to know one language well and be able to solve problems with it at competitions than to know many and solve no problems!

### Which programming language do you use?

Even though there are many languages to choose from, that doesn't mean there aren't preferred languages by the community. On programming competitions, the most popular ones are:

- C++: this language has an extensive algorithms and data structures library built-in, it is the most used by a wide margin
- Python: the most friendly language of all 4 - if you're a newbie, start with this one
- Java: a less popular option, Java is still a solid choice - another language with a rich data structures library
- Kotlin: the creators of Kotlin sponsor ICPC and many other competitions - hence it's growing quickly 

## Meetings

### Where do meetings take place?

Meetings this year are taking place on our Discord server - make sure to join it.

### At what time do meetings happen?

The meeting time hasn't been announced this year yet - we promise to let you know as soon as it's defined.

## Competitions

### In which competitions do you participate?

SPC students have participated in many competitions, such as:

- ICPC Pacific Northwest Programming Contest
- ICPC North America Championship
- Google Code Jam
- Google Kickstart
- Google Hash Code
- Facebook Hacker Cup
- UBC Programming Contest
- Leetcode Round

In particular, for the International Collegiate Programming Competition (ICPC), you can find our previous teams on the [Team](/team) section.

Is there a competitive programming competition we don't know about and you'd like to share? Send it to spc.ubco@gmail.com

### How are teams selected?

Many competitions are individual competitions - e.g. Google Code Jam - hence everyone can register for those, there's no selection.

For competitions with unlimited spots, students decide which teams they form - generally, students with the same programming skills team up together.

For competitions with limited spots or with funding from UBC, it is not SPC that chooses teams - those decisions are made by the Computer Science Department.

## Resources

### Which resources should I use to train?

Check the [Resources for Sessions](/sessions/resources_session/) page - it contains great resources for training.

## Miscellaneous

### What does SPC stand for?

SPC stands for SPC Programming Club.

### How many times does SPC appear in the SPC logo?

SPC appears an infinite amount of times on the SPC logo - not bad eh? Recursion rules.
