# Meeting 9

In this meeting, we will not use vjudge. Instead, we will use problems from Univerity of Erechim's online judge (URI). We opted to do that because after searching on the internet, there were not many problems that were straightforward DFS/BFS problems. Hence, we opted to pick some from the Brazilian Olympiad in Informatics. They are in Portuguese, but Google Translate gives an ok translation of them. The website is in English.
