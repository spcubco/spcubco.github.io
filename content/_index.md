## What is SPC?

SPC is the student-run programming club for the UBC Okanagan Campus! We participate in programming competitions at the national and international level and give the resources for our students to excel at them.

SPC students have participated in competitions such as Google Code Jam, Facebook Hacker Cup, and ACM ICPC.

If you are interested in competing in those or just want to improve your programming skills, this is the club for you!
