Meeting 9 In this meeting, we will not use vjudge. Instead, we will use problems from Univerity of Erechim&amp;rsquo;s online judge (URI). We opted to do that because after searching on the internet, there were not many problems that were straightforward DFS/BFS problems. Hence, we opted to pick some from the Brazilian Olympiad in Informatics.</description>
