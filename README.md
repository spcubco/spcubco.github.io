# SPC UBCO

The Sport Programming Club (SPC) is a club dedicated to foster a problem-solving community on the UBC Okanagan Campus. 

We participate in many programming competitions such as Google Code Jam, Facebook Hacker Cup and ACM ICPC. If you are interested in competing in those or just want to improve your problem-solving skills, just come by our meetings at Wednesday from 18:00 to 20:00 @ ART 102. Pizza provided!
